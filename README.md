## Advent of Code

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challeneges you to complete coding exercises for the 25 days in December leading up to Christmas. I started a bit late - being in the midst of my Flatiorn School final project until Dec. 7th - but I'm excited to participate in my first Advent of Code with my newfound skills!

All the code written for this challenege is using Python 3.7.3 for the 2019 Advent of Code challenege.

Also, as an exercise in writting clean, production-ready code, I have decided to use both type annotations and assert testing. Type annotations are valid starting with Python 3.6. Assert testing is based on the examples and expected results provided.

Enjoy!
